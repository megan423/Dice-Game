# Dice-Game

This is a game I created with C++

1.The program asks for input until a valid choice (4-20) is given by the user

2. The program asks if the user wants to play again after each round (y/n)

3. if yes (y), the user is asked to choose a number of sides again

4. if no (n), the program gives a thank you message and instructs the user to press [RETURN] to exit (and waits for [RETURN] before exiting)
